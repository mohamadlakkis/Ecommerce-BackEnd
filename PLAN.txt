This plan sounds clear and manageable. Here's the detailed step-by-step approach to tackle your project:
Step 1: Understand Requirements and Environment Setup

    Confirm Requirements:
        Finalize service descriptions and overall project architecture.
        List API functionalities for each service.
    Environment Preparation:
        Install Docker and Docker Engine if not already done.
        Install Postman for API testing.
        Set up a Python development environment with pytest.

Deliverables for Step 1:

    Clear service descriptions and functionalities.
    Verified Docker and Postman installations.

Step 2: Database Setup

    Pull the appropriate database image from Dockerhub (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
    Run the database container:
        Configure database ports.
        Set up initial schema and tables based on project requirements.
    Document the database API (if applicable) for the services to interact.

Deliverables for Step 2:

    A running database container with the schema initialized.
    Documentation of the database connection details.

Step 3: Design API for Each Service

    Write detailed API specifications for each service:
        Endpoint details (e.g., URL, method: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE).
        Request payloads and expected responses.
        Authentication requirements (if any).
    Create a Postman collection:
        Include examples and descriptions for each API call.
        Add comments for field specifications.

Deliverables for Step 3:

    Complete API documentation.
    A Postman collection with working API request definitions.

Step 4: Service Development

    Develop each service incrementally:
        Write the service logic in Python or another language of choice.
        Ensure the service runs on a dedicated port and communicates with the database (if required).
    Containerize the service:
        Write a Dockerfile for the service.
        Build and test the Docker image locally.

Deliverables for Step 4:

    Functional service code.
    Dockerized service with no errors during containerization.

Step 5: Inter-Service Communication

    Implement and test API calls between services:
        Validate communication logic (e.g., HTTP requests, responses).
        Handle error scenarios and retries.
    Document how services interact.

Deliverables for Step 5:

    Working inter-service communication.
    Documentation of interaction workflows.

Step 6: Testing

    Write and execute pytest scripts for each service:
        Cover unit tests and integration tests.
        Test edge cases and error handling.
    Use Postman to manually test all API endpoints:
        Validate responses and payloads.
        Check for performance bottlenecks.

Deliverables for Step 6:

    Automated pytest scripts with a test coverage report.
    Verified API functionality via Postman.

Step 7: Final Packaging and Deployment

    Package all services and the database into containers:
        Use Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration.
    Ensure services are deployable on any environment using the Docker setup.

Deliverables for Step 7:

    Docker Compose configuration for seamless deployment.
    Comprehensive documentation for deployment and usage.

Final Notes:

    At each step, progress will only proceed after your approval.
    Memory will be updated accordingly to stay focused on the current task.
    The ultimate objective is a well-tested and deployable backend setup.
